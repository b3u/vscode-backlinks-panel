> ðŸ‘‰ Inspired by [vscode-markdown-notes](https://github.com/kortina/vscode-markdown-notes/).

## Getting Started
:exclamation: Currently, this extension depends on the [roam-style link extension](https://github.com/kortina/vscode-markdown-notes/) by [kortina](https://github.com/kortina). This will likely change in the future.
1. [Install the extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=BinyaminGreen.backlinks-panel) from the Visual Studio Marketplace.
2. In VS Code, link to a file with a wikilink. (Eg. `Here's a link to [[example.md]]`)
3. Open the file you just linked to. In the sidebar, there should be a "backlinks" pane which lists the original file.

## FAQ
**What do you mean by backlinks?**\
Documents in your workspace which link to the current file.

**I don't see my issue listed here**\
Feel free to open an issue. I'll try my best to address it.

## Development
### Running Locally
1. Install dependencies (`npm install`)
2. Open the debug pane in vs code, _OR_, press <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>p</kbd> and enter `?debug`
3. Select "Run Extension"

### Todo
- Expose settings
  - ignored files
- Support traditional links (now, only wikilinks are supported)
- By default, only activate for markdown files (?)
